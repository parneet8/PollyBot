Developed a sophisticated conversational agent designed to assist prospective students in obtaining information about a college. 

This project revolves around the development of a College Inquiry Chatbot System, a sophisticated conversational agent designed to assist prospective students in obtaining information about a college. Leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques, the chatbot engages in meaningful conversations, simulating human-like interactions.

The project utilizes Python as the primary programming language, incorporating various libraries and frameworks such as TensorFlow for deep learning, NLTK for natural language processing, and JSON for data representation. The chatbot is trained on a diverse set of intents, encapsulated in a structured JSON file, enabling it to understand and respond to a wide array of user queries.
